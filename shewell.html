							<h2>Project</h2>
							<p>For the summer school Innovative Digital Technologies for Health at the Politecnico di Milano, me and a group of four others were tasked to develop a case study that offers <b>digital solution contributing to people’s mental wellbeing using new technologies</b>.  This case was presented by the stakeholder Serenis, an Italian Startup that offers remote therapy for peoples mental health. For this we applied a process similar to the Design Thinking process, the <b>Double Diamond process</b> since we had a limited time of one week. 
								<br>In this project we also analysed our idea as Startup, with the business model, competitor analysis and possible risks, however I did not include them since I focus more on the design process in this portfolio.</p>

							<h2>My Role & Key Learnings</h2>
							<p>In the team I acted as <b>project manager</b>, as from the project-based lectures at UTwente, I learned to take the leadership role. For this I <b>defined the process and tasks</b> that we could follow and <b>pushed the project forward when necessary</b>.
							<br> Additionally, I acted as UX and UI designer <b>designing the MVP, the content, and defining what was necessary to design</b>.
							<br> In this project I really learned, <b>how to take a project from start to finish in a week and take actionable decisions quickly</b>. Before, projects normally lasted a full quarter, meaning there was much more time to the process. Here we were forced to finish an MVP in a week and present it in the end. With this I really learned how to push a project forward to make it progress.
							<br> Additionally, I learned also <b>a lot from my group members</b>. I learned practical methods such as creating a <b>design brief in the beginning of the project</b>, to define the project's requirements. Also in the Research and Insights phases I learned a lot how to investigate a topic to understand more about it with methods such as the <b>5W model and defining the ecosystem</b>.

							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>We conducted extensive research into the topic of mental health, using the <b> 5W Model (where, why, how, who, and when)</b>, which we used to develop deeper insight into the topic. We found that mental health conditions are widespread with <b>1 in 8 people living with a mental health condition</b>, that it is undertreated with 71% people with psychosis not receiving treatment, and just 2% of health budgets normally planned for mental health. We also found that <b>women live with mental health disorders</b> , of the 970 million people living mental disorders are 52.4% female. We also found that in many settings, digital technologies could offer promising solutions to strengthen mental health. 
								Since we were a majority of women in our team and felt very passionate about this problem, <b>decided on designing a solution for women to help them take care of their mental health</b> . We decided on the target group of women in Italy since Serenis, the Startup we created this case study for concentrated on the Italian market for now.</p>

							<h2>Insights</h2>
							<p>From our research we created a design brief that summarised our goals for the project. 
								<br> In this we defined our goal for the project to develop a digital platform/feature that specifically addresses <b>mental health needs of women in Italy</b>. By leveraging new technologies, we aim to provide <b>accessible, personalised, and empowering mental health support to women</b>, ultimately improving their overall well-being. 
								<br> Our objectives were make mental health support <b>more accessible and more personalised</b>, as well <b>as empowering the target group with education</b>.
								<br> Additionally, we created a persona that summarised the needs, positive and negative trends, opportunities, hopes, headaches and fears of our target group women. Also we defined an ecosystem that our target group had in the context of mental health.

							<h2>Ideation</h2>
							<p>After structuring our insights and deciding on the problem we wanted to focus on, we defined the question <b>“How might we provide an effective mental health solution for women in order to prevent mental health disorders using new technologies?”</b>. From this question we started to ideate possible solutions. We saw different directions we could go, including social platforms, wearable devices, AI assistants/digital twin or tangible devices. After discussing we decided <b>to combine the technologies AI assistance, wearables and social platforms</b>, to create a platform that offers <b>a space for women to get personalised information, and a safe space to communicate with others about their feelings and problems.</b> To develop our idea further we created the graph that defined the architecture of the app with its functionalities.</p>

							<h2>Prototype</h2>
							<p>From the defined functionalities we also defined a possible <b>user journey</b> our target group could go through. We defined the different phases of the Onboarding, Tracking, Managing, Improving, and Informing. Additionally we created a <b>user flow</b> that described the functional flow through the app. This helped us to define what we wanted to include in our MVP. We decided on the <b>Home tab, which offered mood & period tracking, data insights, and the digital twin that the user could chat with.</b> Also we decided to design the <b> Explore tab that showed examples of the personalised articles that the user could browse through</b>. We skipped the Community tab, which had a discussion and virtual meet-up area, the Self-care tab that offered guided meditations and a meet space with their therapists, and the Profile tab with settings, life stage selection and digital twin management. We decided to not include these tabs due to time constraints and since the Home and Explore tab illustrated our idea enough.

							<h2>Impact</h2>
							<p>The solution we came up with that offers a digital solution contributing to people’s mental wellbeing using new technologies and the question “How might we provide an effective mental health solution for women in order to prevent mental health disorders using new technologies?”  is SheWell, which is <b>a platform designed to support women in their mental health journey</b>. It addresses the <b>significant mental health challenges faced by women, leveraging artificial intelligence and a 'digital twin' concept to provide personalised mental health solutions</b>.
