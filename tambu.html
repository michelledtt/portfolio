							<h2>Project</h2>
							<p>For the class Experience Design for Interaction at the University of Twente, me and a group of four others were tasked to design a <b>ixed Reality adaptation of the Korsou - Curacao exposition from the Dutch National Archive</b>, which was a exposition about the Dutch Colonialisation of Curaçao from different views. 
							<br>We applied the Research through Design (RtD) process, which is <b>a process that employs the practices and process of design methods with the intention of generating new knowledge</b>. 
							<br>The focus of the course was additionally <b>experimental reflection, where the designers rely on their own experiences to make design decisions.</b></p>

							<h2>Designing for a Sensitive Topic</h2>
							<p><b>The topic of colonalisation and slavery is a very sensitive one, and it was of highest importance for me and my group to create a respectful and accurate representation of history</b>. When we talked with our stakeholders of the National Archive of whom one was from Curaçao, we got reassurance that we were able to achieve this and create an accurate experience.
							<br>To achieve this, I think the most important factors were <b>to define an impact statement</b>, with a clear idea of what we wanted to create, <b>to conduct extensive research</b>, to help to make the experience accurate, and <b>to give a stage to the voices that once or still are oppressed</b>. For the latter point, here we focused on finding sources from Curaçaon people or interviews with them.

							<h2>My Role & Key Learnings</h2>
							<p>In this project, we were a multi-disciplinary team, with me being the only HUman-Computer Interaction student, and for me creating a sensitive design to the history was of highest importance as described above. This made me <b>take initiative on research, ideation, and overall project management, which I had learned from previous projects.</b>
								<br> I learned a lot from this project, since it had different design methods to what I was used to. In general I learned that sometimes <b>it is good to stay in the undecided for longer regarding the design, as this helps to keep molding the design to improve it a long the process. Also Soma Design, which is a method which focuses on testing it by yourself and seeing how the design feels</b>, was an insightful design method to learn. Finally, as my personal goal was to stay respectful with this senstive topic, it really helped me <b>to set boundaries and take agency on issues I am passionate about</b>. Here helpful methods for me were <b>to define an impact statement, which helps to keep the project focused, and do a deep dive on the topic as the knowledge from it helped to make the design so much more detailed and thought-out.</b> </p>

							<h2>Research</h2>
							<p>In the beginning of the project we had to decide around which artefact from the National Archive we wanted to create an experience. We decided on the artefact Tambù, which is a curaçaon instrument, that was continuously oppressed throughout history. We had our <b>first virtual reality workshop in which we could get an impression about the technology</b>. We also started <b>to research about its history, as well as Embodied Sketching techniques which are helpful for designing Mixed Reality experience</b> as you can test out how different ideas feel and if they communicate the things you want. Additionally, we looked into papers that talked about designing virtual experiences for museums. 
							<br>Some important insights we learned were that <b>it is alright to stay in the undecided during the design process, as it helps ideas to evolve and become better</b>. Additionally, we learned that <b>by interacting with museum objects, it promotes empathy and a deep connection between the visitor and the history</b>.</p>

							<h2>Ideation</h2>
							<p>When we started ideating we first came up with ideas individually and then combined them to come up with ideas, as we read that this helps in coming up with better quality ideas. We grouped the similar ideas into categories and discussed them. In lecture, we got <b>the insight that when working with sensitive topics, it helps to come up with metaphors, as these are able to communicate the sentiment without troubling the visitor</b>. So during our ideation we also ideated which metaphors we could use.
							<br>In our next virtual reality workshop, we tried out different ideas and focused on how they made us feel, and if we thought they worked. This helped to concretise our idea.</p>

							<h2>Idea</h2>
							<p>The visitor <b>receives a book in real life</b>, which is <b>mapped in the virtual reality experience and can be used as controller</b>. Through this book the visitor can see into the past in the experience and can use it to <b>teleport to three different points in the past</b>. The visitor <b>is guided by sounds to understand where to go</b>.
							<br>The first scene <b>in history during colonial and slavery times</b>. It was the first time that Tambù was forbidden, and it was done to control the enslaved community. However the enslaved people still did the Tambù ritual in the hidden and this can be observed by the visitor.
							<br>The second scene is <b>in postcolonial times</b>, where the Catholic Church condemned Tambù, again to exert control on the Curaçaon people.
							<br>The third scene is in <b>modern times in 2010</b>. The government created laws to limit participation of Tambù from 1935-2010. 
							<br>In every scene, the visitor <b>gets insight about the perspectives against Tambù, but also positive ones that explain the actual meaning behind the ritual.</b>
							Our message is <b>to show the resilience and triumph of the Tambù against various forms of oppression through four centuries.</b></p>

							<h2>Implementation</h2>
							<p>During the project, we received <b>continuous feedback from our professors, as well as from the stakeholders the National Archive</b>. We implemented the project with <b>Neos VR</b>, which is a virtual world platform that allows users <b>to explore, create, and share virtual reality (VR) worlds and experiences more easily. It offers a low-code platform in which you can simply drag and drop the objects</b>. The courses focus was however more on the design of the experience than the implementation, so we received support to implement the ideas we wanted.

							<h2>Impact</h2>
							<p>The final result is an experience in which <b>the visitor can travel through time to explore Tambù through time, and that it was able to survive inspite of its continuous oppression</b>. 
								<br>
								<h5>We want our experience to create empathy and understanding about Tambùs perseverance throughout history, and inspire people to continue exploring the exhibition.</h5>
