							<h2>Project</h2>
							<p>For the class Design Thinking for Service and Business Design at the University of Twente, me and a group of five others were tasked to use the Design Thinking process <b>to find a solution to the challenge “How to develop a neighbourhood where people are 100% happy and CO2 emissions are 0%?”</b> with the dutch construction company Revolve, that focuses exactly on this challenge.</p>

							<h2>My Role & Key Learnings</h2>
							<p>We were a multi-displinary team with different backgrounds, and I was the the only Human-Computer Interaction major with another team member. Because of this <b>I took the lead on processes that I had experience on already.</b> These included <b>conducting user interviews, organizing the mindmap when we had a plethora of ideas, and defining a How Might We question.</b> 
								<br> My key learnings during the project were <b>going through a fully Design Thinking cycle</b>, which helped get a feel for how projects using this method look, and what are the strengths of it, which are that it is very engaging and helps to find innovative solutions. It also really helped me <b>to approach people in public to interview them, which now is easier for me.</b> In our team, we also had team members who had strengths in project management and organization, <b>which really helped me to learn from their example to take agency in a team project, and implement these qualities in future projects such as SheWell or Tambù</b>.

							<h2>Context</h2>
							<p>Before starting the Design Thinking process, we first established the context by researching the topics. We researched the trends and development of sustainability and happiness, the topics, the sector and the organisation Revolve. Additionally, we collected inspiration for the project. In our research, <b>we found out that nature makes people more happy, and water makes them more relaxed. </b>
							<br>We had to decide on a focus for the project and decided to focus on an iconic university building called <b>Cubicus</b>, which is well known but also has aged and will be renovated soon. <b>It is a lecture and office building with a brutalistic style, and the idea behind its structure is to make it as confusing as possible so that people have to ask for help which fosters social interaction.</b> It is surrounded by water and nature, inside though it is grey and does not have a lot of natural light. We wanted to take this iconic building and improve the experience in it, while keeping its iconic character.  On the right, you can see the research done collected in a Miro Board. </p>

							<h2>Empathise</h2>
							<p>In the Empathise phase the goal is to <b>understand the users needs</b>. So we researched the needs of the students and the employees of the building. In class, we got presented 12 methods, of which we applied 7.
							<br>We split up, and I was responsible for the ground work, interviewing employees in the building. <b>I utilised the methods customer journey, 3 why’s, and the value proposition canvas</b>. This taught me valuable practice in interviewing random people in public. After everyone did their research, <b>we created a mind map of all our findings, grouping them in the categories, inside and outside the building and then creating subcategories.</b>
							<br>We found that students did not really like the building, however employees that spent more time there liked it and enjoyed it. Both groups really liked the nature outside.</p>

							<h2>Define</h2>
							<p>The Define phase is there to clearly state the problem. It takes all the insights from the Empathise phase and from the context to formulate a problem statement. <b>This helps to make the problem more concrete and easier to ideate a solution to</b>. Additionally, you define your principles and impact that you want to create, which helps to focus the following process.
							<br>In our Define phase we focused on formulating a <b>“How might we…?” question, defining an impact mission and defining our design principles</b>. We decided to focus on <b>“How might we turn the Cubicus into a stress free environment?”</b>, because with our research we found how to use nature to create stress free spaces, and as part of the challenge we wanted to make the inhabitants “100% happy”. For our impact statement we defined <b>“To create a sustainable space for users that minimises their carbon footprint and maximises the well-being of its occupants.”</b>, which restated the challenge that was given to us in the beginning. Finally, our aesthetic principles were to used relaxing colours such as blue and green, and relaxing shapes and materials, so more rounded shapes and minimalistic and natural textures. Our functional principles were sustainability, mindfulness and users first. Our value principles as team were <b>authentic, cheerful, inspiring, solution-orientated and open</b>, and for our project were <b>diverse, circular and cheerful.</b></p>

							<h2>Ideate</h2>
							<p>The goal of the Ideate phase is <b>to generate a lot of creative solutions</b>. It has been show to promote the quality of the ideas, if first people ideate individually, and then come together and connect their ideas together. We utilised a plethora of methods during the design process which are visualised on the left. 
							<br>The lighter methods were done in the beginning individually and then in the detective board we combined our ideas and looked for similarities. We came up with the supertitle <b>“Bring the outside in, and the inside out.”</b> based on our ideas. The dutch weather is often quite grey and rainy, so we wanted to bring the benefits from nature inside so they could be enjoyed year-round. Additionally, in summer when the weather is good you want to enjoy it but it is difficult to work outside. So we wanted to create a workspace outside where the weather can be enjoyed in the few weeks where the weather is actually nice. From this motto, we conducted a few other methods to develop more concrete ideas.</p>

							<h2>Prototype</h2>
							<p>The goal of the Prototyping phase is to create a rough model of the idea to test in in the next phase. We decided due to time pressure <b>to model the buildings outline in Miro and visualise the rooms with mood boards</b>. Since we conducted a lot of research we also decided to link the research depending on the rooms to rationalise the design decisions, which is not described detailed in this portfolio. The final prototype can be found on the bottom of the page.</p>

							<h2>Test</h2>
							<p>The goal of the Test phase is to gather user feedback. We conducted <b>interviews with possible users and after each one to two rounds we improved the prototype following the feedback</b>. We interviewed 5 students in total and two experts, of which one studied landscape design and another studied architecture. We asked them about <b>their likes and dislikes, their feelings about the design, what they would improve, what they think would not work out and finally what they would change</b>. These questions were inspired by the previous methods used in the Empathise and Ideate phase that were presented to us in the lecture. In total, we created three iterations of the prototype. </p>

							<h2>Impact</h2>
							<p>The solution we came up with to the challenge <b>“How to develop a neighbourhood where people are 100% happy and CO2 emissions are 0%?” And the How Might We question “How might we turn the Cubicus into a stress free environment?”</b> was a university concept building that <b>unifies nature and productivity with the motto “Outside In and Inside Out”.</b> It tackles the <b>pain point of not being around nature a lot in the colder seasons by bringing nature in with lots of plants in the study area and a relaxing room which also offers natural textures to wind down</b>. Additionally, it offers an attractive space to stay as it has a kitchen you can prepare your lunch in. For the warmer times, it offers a lot of study spaces outside with plugs, shades and water options, and the rooftop is extended so student associations can plant food there to foster community and understanding of food. If its sunny but not warm enough the sunroom allows to enjoy the warmth of the sun and the daylight while being inside.</p>
							<h5>"Bringing the outside in, and the inside out" helps to create a more sustainable university building that offers a positive lifestyle to the people in it.</h5>
